Air Quality information for a traveller. 

## Description

The TravelBug web application allows a user to find current air quality data for a location. This location can be entered manually or accessed with the "find my location" button.

This button accesses the users geoLocation through the IP address, and can provide air quality data for that location.

The "find my location" feature will not work if the user is accessing the web application through a VPN.

Each location submission is saved to the "Search History" tab.

For more information please access the "About" tab on the TravelBug application.
